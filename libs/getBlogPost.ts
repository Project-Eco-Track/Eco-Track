    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    Climate change and global warming are pressing issues that require
    immediate attention. One of the key contributors to these
    environmental problems is the increasing carbon footprint. Carbon
    footprint refers to the total amount of greenhouse gases, primarily
    carbon dioxide, emitted by an individual, organization, or product
    throughout its lifecycle.

    <h2>Tips for Reducing Carbon Footprint</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Use Renewable Energy</h3>
        <p>
        Switching to renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power
        can significantly reduce your carbon footprint. Consider
        installing solar panels at your home or switch to a green energy
        provider.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Conserve Energy</h3>
        <p>
        Be mindful of your energy consumption. Turn off lights and
        appliances when not in use, use energy-efficient light bulbs, and
        insulate your home properly to reduce the need for heating or
        cooling.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h3>
        <p>
        Practice the three R's: reduce, reuse, and recycle. Minimize waste
        by avoiding single-use items, opting for reusable products, and
        separating recyclables from trash.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Choose Sustainable Transportation</h3>
        <p>
        Whenever possible, use public transportation, carpool, or
        bike/walk instead of driving alone. If you need a car, choose a
        fuel-efficient or electric vehicle to minimize emissions.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Eat Sustainable</h3>
        <p>
        Adopt a more sustainable diet by reducing meat consumption,
        especially beef, as livestock production has a high carbon
        footprint. Opt for locally sourced, organic, and seasonal food
        whenever possible.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Support Green Businesses</h3>
        <p>
        Choose to support companies and businesses that prioritize
        sustainability and have eco-friendly practices. Encourage and
        promote sustainable initiatives in your community.
        </p>
